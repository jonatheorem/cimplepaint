# A simple (cimple) library for drawing in image files in C.

The objective is to have a library in C to make simple drawings. 
Currently the output is a ppm file. In the future we will draw to a Xlib
window or png file. 

I'm doing this to learn how to do simple graphics and for playing with Xlib
and image file formats.

In the longer run I see this library rendering stl files in a Xlib window.
All of this with minimal requirement, only C programming language and minimal
requirements of third prty libraries.

## The greatest achivement up to now is drawing triangles
